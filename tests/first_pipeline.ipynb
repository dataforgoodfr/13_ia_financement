       "['Brief project description East Kalimantan Province in 2021/2022 received great attention nationally because of the moving of the state capital city (Jakarta) to a location near the city of Balikpapan and Penajam Paser Utara in East Kalimantan Province. The development of the new capital will start in 2022. Although the Indonesia President commit to develop the new capital as Forest and Smart City, the surrounding area particularly the coastal area such as Delta Mahakam and Adang Bay might get high pressure as the consequence of the new development and the movement of 1.5 million people to the new capital. Delta Mahakam, in the eastern part of East Kalimantan, is an area that is relatively close to the prospective center of the State capital (about 100 km). Mahakam Delta is naturally a mangrove habitat, but due to excessive land clearing for extensive aquaculture about 47.5 % of the mangrove ecosystem is degraded to be converted into aquaculture (2017). Despite various conservation efforts by different parties and the government, land clearing still continues. Delta Mahakam land ownership is government land that has designated as a production forest, but this area has been inhabited by residents from generation to generation.',\n",
       " \"Adang Bay is one of the coastal villages in Adang Bay, Paser Regency, on the southern part of East Kalimantan Province (about 100 km from the new capital). This area is also experiencing land conversion to increase aquaculture, besides there are several locations in coastal areas that are affected by abrasion. Restoration activities in East Kalimantan Province are needed to restore a degraded environment, as well as to support the vision of the nation's capital as a green city. The ecosystem in Delta Mahakam and Adang Bay are also home to critically endangered species, such as the nasal monkey (proboscis monkey), endemic to the island of Borneo. On a global scale, the mangrove is a key ecosystem to answer the challenge of carbon sequestration and fight against climate change.\",\n",

This organization was formed with the objective to raise public attention to preserve coastal and marine ecosystems that are rich in biodiversity, including clusters of mangrove areas, distribution of coral reefs and seagrass beds. In addition, government policies towards fishermen communities also need to be continuously encouraged in order to be optimal for the welfare of fishermen. The lives of fishermen in coastal areas in East Kalimantan Province often experience difficulties due to the privatization of coastal areas, difficulties in obtaining fuel for fishing boats, and also low human resources.',\n",
       " 'Based on these issues, a group of activists agreed in 2009 to establish an organization which was later named the “Coastal and Fisherman Working Group”. This institution has been advocating policies for improving coastal and marine governance and carrying out empowerment actions for fishing communities. As an effort to preserve the coastal area, the “Coastal and Fishermen Working Group” initiated a program called Mangrove and Marine Protection Area in Teritip Village, East Balikpapan Sub-district, Balikpapan City, in collaboration with UNDP in 2009 – 2010. The Working Group then change the name to “Pokja Pesisir” and was legally registered at the Ministry of Law and Human Rights in 2018.

Context & environment and development challenges Geographic and socio-economic context East Kalimantan is one of the richest provinces in Indonesia and the main contribution to the national GDP. Before palm oil and mining coal booming in early 2000, forestry, mining and gas sectors are the backbone of economic development in East Kalimantan. Because too much depending on the unrenewable natural resources, the economic growth of East Kalimantan gradually declines and, in 2016, reached the minus point because of the lowest price of coal at the global level. In 2019, Indonesia government has decided to move the capital of Indonesia from Jakarta to East Kalimantan. Currently, the government accelerate the infrastructure development of new capital.',\n",
       " \"The project will be implemented in several regions of Mahakam Delta and Adang Bay. Mahakam Delta is located on the eastern coast of the island of Borneo, in East Kalimantan province, which is one of the five provinces that has the lowest population density in Indonesia. This province is also the main contributor to the national GDP, mainly for its wealth in oil and gas. It is nevertheless aquaculture activities which constitute the main source of income for the local population. About 90% of the population depend on it for their livelihood. As a result, 54.19% of the Mahakam Delta has been converted to shrimp ponds. The majority of exports from the area are made up of tiger shrimp and white shrimp that are farmed in the delta ponds and along the Paser District's shore. Feature 1: Land cover in mahakam delta and adang is dominated by fish pond area\",\n",
       " \"Paser District is located on the east coast of East Kalimantan Province. The village of Adang Bay is located in the coastal area of this district, in Adang Bay. This area is a conservation area managed by the Ministry of Forestry (KPHP). Therefore, limited economic activities are allowed in this area. However, since the late 1990s, massive clearing for the construction of aquaculture ponds has destroyed the mangrove forest in the area. According to the District Pastor's Investment Agency, about 1,506 people live in Adang Bay. Most of them work as fishermen, fish farmers and swallowers. The village government and the community have made a strong commitment to conserve the area by adhering to the jurisdictional REDD+ approach, funded by the World Bank's FCPF or Forest Carbon Partnership Facility Project. Environmental context\",\n",
       " \"Largest archipelago in the world (more than 13,000 islands), Indonesia has an area of \\u200b\\u200b1,905,000 km2 of which less than 50% is still covered by forests today, while the country is part of the 3rd largest planetary tropical forest zone (after the Amazon and the Congo Basin). More than half of Indonesian forests have disappeared since 1960. However, they are home to a large part of the world's biodiversity (more than 10% respectively of plant, mammal, reptile and bird species). Today, the country counts for 3 to 5% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions (among the 10 most emitting countries) including more than 50% due to land use, their change of land use and the exploitation of forests. Indonesia is home to almost 1/4 of the world's mangroves (20%). This maritime ecosystem, made up of a set of mainly woody plants (the most notable species being the mangrove), develops in the swinging area of the tides of the low coasts and in marshes at the mouth of certain rivers.  Of the nearly 3.2 million hectares of mangrove forest in the country today, more than 50,000 ha are lost each year.\",\n",
       " \"The mangrove is one of the most productive ecosystems on the planet, home to a particularly abundant biomass. The mangroves' root system is notably a biotope where a variety of fish and crabs live and reproduce. The mangrove thus provides important resources (forestry and fishery) to coastal populations, a natural “buffer” zone adapted to salinity, filtering sediment and pollution carried by rivers and the sea, and preserving the fresh water resources of the land. They are a food security and livelihood issue, in particular providing income to fishing communities. This ecosystem is also an important natural fount of carbon, with Indonesian mangroves storing around 5 times more carbon per hectare than terrestrial forests. The government of Indonesia has taken into account this ecosystem in its REDD+ strategy, implemented in the only pilot province of East-Kalimantan, with the Provincial Council on Climate Change (DDPI) with the support of the World Bank in the framework of the “Forest Carbon Partnership Facility Project”.\",\n",
       " 'Finally, the mangrove plays a key role in natural defense. The complex network of mangrove roots can help reduce wave power, which limits erosion and protects coastal communities from the destructive forces of tropical storms. Mangroves provide protection against extreme weather events and tsunamis, and can adapt to rising sea levels and subsidence. They therefore contribute to reducing the risk of disasters, to the resilience of communities and ecosystems and to their adaptation to climate change. In Mahakam Delta, results from a study conducted in 2018 and 2019 by the Kutai Kartanegara District has shown that 47.8% of mangrove forests are deteriorated. Table 1. Critical Criteria of Mahakam Delta Mangrove Source: The Result of Spatial Analysis of Mangrove Damage Level (2018)',\n",
       " 'With the plan to move the state capital to Penajam Paser Utara District (PPU), the development activities to create this new big city will take place massively. The central government has planned to create a green city for the new capital, which construction will start in 2022, but various problems still pose challenges in locations outside the new capital. On the one hand, a close government center can control the surrounding environment to keep it conserved, but the gap in the quality of human resources and plans to move a large number of people from Jakarta to this area will certainly cause pressure on the environment. Biodiversity issues The mangrove of Mahakam Delta conceals a rich marine and arboreal biodiversity, characterized by a large variety of fish, arthropods, reptiles such as the marine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), aquatic mammals such as the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) or terrestrial like the nasal monkey (Nasalis larvatus), these last 2 species being considered as being “endangered” by the IUCN.',\n",
       " 'The deforestation of Mahakam Delta’s mangrove hampers the effort to conserve this type of species, for example by fragmenting the habitat of the nasal monkey, whose interaction between populations strongly depends on the continuity of the canopy. The isolation of these populations makes them more vulnerable to poaching. The long-nosed monkey, endemic of Borneo Island is listed as “Endangered” by the IUCN as it has undergone extensive population reductions across its range, and ongoing hunting and habitat destruction continue to threaten most populations. Numbers have declined by more than 50% (but probably less than 80%) over the past 3 generations (approximately 36-40 years). At the scale of Mahakam Delta, only 2 censuses have been conducted to monitor this specie, respectively in 1997 and 2005 which reflects the lack of resources of local institutions to conserve and protect this biodiversity.',\n",
       " 'In addition, the degradation of this ecosystem leads to a decrease in fish stocks in the delta, threatening both fishermen and species such as sea crocodiles and dolphins. The situation is currently might threatening to exacerbate human-animal conflicts and therefore to further decrease the populations of the above-mentioned species, even threatening them with extinction. Hence, beside preventing the mangrove forest conversion into palm oil plantation, aquaculture ponds, and other usages, the reforestation activity is necessary to improve the degraded mangrove ecosystem in the coastal area. Paradoxically, the considerable modification of delta habitats resulted in a very substantial increase in populations of birds associated with open wet areas, such as egrets (100 individuals in 1987 to nearly 15,000 individuals in 2013). Likewise, some species of heron have seen their population sizes increase considerably, such as the purple heron or the Javan pond-heron, the lesser adjutant, ducks, Sunda teal and the wandering whistling-duck also seem to have used the habitats created by the clearings to considerably increase their populations.',\n",
       " 'The populations of these species have benefited of new feeding areas when the shrimp ponds were developed. Indeed, egrets, ducks, and waders use the shrimp ponds in high numbers on cyclical basis when shrimp ponds are emptied for shrimp harvesting. The presence of pristine areas, with large trees or dense copses of smaller species (Nypa) removed from human presence, is also favourable for the reproduction of these species. Here they find quiet conditions for reproduction or gatherings (dormitories). Amongst the species observed in 2013 and those not observed in 1987, eight dwell in an aquatic environment and directly depend on the shrimp ponds: darter, stilts, grey heron, black-crowned night heron, intermediate egret, western marsh-harrier and the Garganey. The opening of shrimp ponds was the obvious factor leading to the growth of all these bird populations. Institutional Context',\n",
       " 'The key players in coastal region in East Kalimantan including in Delta Mahakam Ulu (Delta Mahakam) and Delta Mahakam (Adang Bay) are relatively similar. Since the area located or nearby the conservation area and forest production area, the Ministry of Forestry via Nature Conservancy Agency in East Kalimantan and Forest Management Unit (provincial government agency) are the most influence actor. They have authority to determine the activities which allowed and not allowed in the area. However, they cannot control the vast area of conservation area since 50 percent of mangrove forest in the region have been degraded. Besides government, the others key actors are fishermen, fish farmers, swallow workers and investors in aquaculture sectors. Those actors have shaped the landscape of coastal area in Delta Mahakam and Adang Bay over the past 20 years. In their hand the future of sustainable aquaculture is determined.  Environmental and development NGOs, oil and gas company and other parties has programme in their area. Most of the programme focus on improving the livelihood of the local people and restoring the mangrove forest. The Movement of Indonesian New Capital',\n",
       " \"Paser District (East Kalimantan Province) will soon be the site of Indonesia's new political capital, Nusantara, as part of the plan to move the country's capital from the island of Java to the island of Borneo, which is home to one of the world’s largest rainforests. Jakarta, the current political capital which will become the country's economic capital by 2045, is currently facing several environmental, climatic and demographic problems and challenges: overpopulation, heavy pollution, rising water levels, frequent flooding, etc. In order to deal with the inevitable future security issue, the Indonesian government has decided to build a new capital 2,000 km away from Jakarta, in the province of East Kalimantan, more precisely between the towns of Balikpapan and Samarinda. With the legislation for the relocation of the new capital published, the physical development of the new capital will begin in 2022. In August 2024, the President plans to celebrate Indonesia's Independence Day in the new capital.\",\n",
       " 'The government plans to make the new capital a \"forest city\" by strongly preserving forest areas and using sustainable energy. However, many argue that the development of the new capital could lead to environmental degradation and loss of essential biodiversity, especially in the mangrove forest. The majority of the Indonesian population, including the local population, supports the new capital movement by echoing the effect of equitable development. Indeed, for decades, the natural resources of Kalimantan Island have been exploited to support Indonesian development, especially that of Java Island. The location of the project (Delta Mahakam and Adang Bay -Adang Bay) is an area relatively close to the potential centre of the state capital (about 100-200 km). Environment and development challenges Aquaculture industry',\n",
       " 'Mahakam Delta area is under pressure from both the industrial and agricultural sectors, including aquaculture facing a national high dynamic. From 2015 to 2035 it is expected a destruction of 600,000 ha of mangrove for shrimp farm at the national scale. The World Bank (2013) estimates a pressure to double cultivated shrimp production from currently 300,000 t (produced by 600,000 ha of ponds) to 600,000 t/1,000,000 t by 2030 to fulfil the demand. However, with improvements in brackish water aquaculture productivity, halting palm oil concession to use mangroves, along with maintaining other mangrove use pressures at moderate levels, the net loss of mangroves in the next two decades could be reduced to around 23,000 ha at this same scale. The East-Kalimantan Province is the new area to develop aquaculture ponds as Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi islands are facing a decrease of the production and the destruction of their environment due to unsustainable practices.',\n",
       " 'Feature 1: Forecasted mangrove loss at six mangrove regions in Indonesia in the next two decades due to land use change under pessimistic scenario. Circle size indicates potential loss areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Papua; as for Java, Sulawesi and Maluku potential loss areas are represented by the smaller circles. Scientific studies also show that the percentage of mangrove natural recovery is higher in East-Kalimantan with 1.4%/year against 0.7%/year in other islands in inactive ponds. This suggests to consider conservation activities in specific areas of Mahakam Delta. At the scale of Mahakam Delta, the table below for which the percentage (43.7%) is as higher as the remaining mangrove forest (48.5%) highlights the dominance of aquaculture. Table 2. Types of Land Cover and Land Use in Mahakam Delta Source: Result of SPOT satellite images 6/7 (2018) Demography',\n",
       " 'The demographic issue must also be considered. Indeed, the announcement in 2019 of the relocation of the political and administrative capital of Jakarta to the province of East Kalimantan, between the cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda, suggests strong migrations, the development of infrastructures but also a growing demand for aquaculture products. By 2024, the Indonesian Minister of Planning hopes to transfer nearly 1.5 million public officials and political representatives in East Kalimantan.',\n",
       " \"Delta Mahakam Ulu village, which belongs to Delta Mahakam district, is located in the northern part of the Mahakam Delta. The location of Delta Mahakam sub-district is close to the state-owned oil company (Pertamina), formerly VICO. Due to the proximity of a fairly large company, the community's economy is quite dynamic and the area offers a variety of jobs. However, the number of people who still carry out the traditional work of fishermen and fish farmers is still quite high, especially in the coastal areas. Working as a fish farmer has become one of the choices of the community as land is available for opening ponds. The conversion of mangrove forests into ponds has been going on for decades, but the production of fish and shrimp has decreased from time to time. Based on various studies and research, planting a number of mangroves in ponds can improve the soil and water quality in the ponds so that they can provide sustainable production. The farmer groups in Delta Mahakam Ulu ponds are beginning to realise the importance of planting mangroves in the ponds, and therefore need support from various parties. Other issues\",\n",
       " 'The table below represents a summary of estimation of potential loss and gain of mangroves in six major regions by 2035. The Kalimantan Island is the one to analyze in order to justify Planète Urgence and partners’ information. The analysis does not yet consider the movement of new capital issue which very likely affect the mangrove forest in East Kalimantan as well. This table highlight the multiple and complex context in which mangrove loss depends and confirms challenges faced in Mahakam Delta area. The lack of resources (financial, human resources, material) of local authorities coupled with a lack of transparency, coordination and communication around responsibilities of each actors impacts the management of mangrove forests, natural resources and territorial development.',\n",
       " 'Another issue that has also had a major impact on life in Indonesia, including East Kalimantan, is the Covid 19 global pandemic that has attacked the entire world since early 2020. The Covid 19 pandemic has had a major impact on life in Indonesia. East Kalimantan is a province outside Java Island with the highest rate of exposure to Covid, which has resulted in the government imposing a lockdown and restrictions on community activities. At the beginning of 2022, community activities began to return to normal, but a new variant emerged, namely Omicron, which spread very quickly. Facing a pandemic situation that has not ended, of course, the project must continue but still pay attention to security, safety, and practice health protocols. Strategy & theory of change The three years project aims to contribute to restore the degraded of mangrove ecosystem in Production Forest (Mahakamm Delta) and Conservation area (Adang Bay). In doing so, the project will address the key problems in those regions: Lack of awareness of local people on mangrove ecosystem, biodiversity issue and waste',\n",

       " 'In Delta Mahakam, Planète Urgence will work in a close collaboration with the Yayasan Mangrove Lestari Delta Mahakam (YML) which cooperation has started with Planète Urgence at the end of 2nd term of year 2012 (period of October-December) with a focus on mapping the Mahakam Delta region, as a tool for preparing a joint action plan in 2013. Furthermore, the implementation of joint program in 2013 included reforestation activities, access to micro-credit for community groups, capacity building of community groups (male and female groups) and program coordination at the district level together with BAPPEDA (Agency for Regional Development) of Kutai Kartanegara District and several other regional organizations. Designing and carrying out the activities integrating through MADIMAP (Mahakam Delta Integrative Management Program) for the period of 2014 to 2016 and January - March 2017 with the main funding from Trafigura Foundation. In 2019 until 2021, YML and Planète Urgence again collaborated in large-scale awareness-raising activities (radio podcasts) related to the protection of mangrove forests and their biodiversity, as well as to promote the sustainable aquaculture in the region.

       " 'Expected capacity building of implementing partners: To support Pokja Pesisir and YML in implementing the activities, Planète Urgence will continuously collaborate with partners to identify capacity-building needs. PU will provide support to YML and Pokja Pesisir in its financial and accountability reporting of the MAHAKAM project following PU’s process, mainly required by donors. This training will be conferred by the Administrative and Financial staff of Planète Urgence Indonesia. The training will be done in the first two months of the project and PU will continuously monitor the impact of the training to ensure the partner implement the PU standard. YML and Pokja Pesisir will also be helped in monitoring and project management. PU will share their experience and manual in monitoring and managing the project to the partner. The transfer knowledge will be done at the beginning of the project. Refreshment training of reforestation project particularly for Pokja Pesisir including technical issue such as establishing nursury, planting tree, identifying location Rapid Needs Assessment on Capacity Building to identify the needs of capacity building for the partners.',\n",
       " 'The project will continuously identify further needs regarding the project or partner structuration. Capacity building needs could also be supported by Planète Urgence’s volunteerism programme (if the organization and the logistic of the mission meet all required criteria). CAPACITY BUILDING PLAN Roles and responsibilities: Activities will be implemented under the responsibility of  Planète Urgence and its partners (Pokja Pesisir and YML). These partners will design, develop, implement and monitor the activities under their responsibility. Both implementing partners will play an important coordination role with partners, beneficiaries, community groups and local authorities. Planète Urgence will support them in the project management and discussions with local authorities regarding governance strategy, project monitoring and evaluation, identification of capacity building needs for partners and specific project components, as well as the building of a multi-year vision (context and needs assessment and update, project scaling-up and sustainability). Key stakeholders: Planète Urgence also encourages YML and Pokja Pesisir to collaborate with other relevant local stakeholders from various groups such as local community organizations, business groups and government agencies from district to national levels. The following table lists potential partners and the respective roles they could play in the NEW MAHAKAM project: Cross-cutting approaches',\n",
       " 'In 2019, Planète Urgence has conducted a social analysis in Muara Kembang to examine how different individuals and groups may affect the project and how the project will affect them. During this study, Planète Urgence has collected, identified and analysed information on the different roles, responsibilities, needs and interests of women and men of targeted groups in Muara Kembang village. To capture the nuances of various social characteristics, the data and analysis on women and men should are disaggregated by social categories relevant to the project (e.g., socio-economic status, profession) during these 3 years. Below are presented the results of the socio-economic analysis of targeted communities, with 80% of respondents. The last Gender Gap Report 2020 of the World Economic Forum has ranked Indonesia on position 86 on a total of 153 countries regarding gender inclusion and equality. The National Gender Mainstreaming Policy enacted in 2000 (through The Presidential Decree in) guides the National Long-term Development Plan (RPJPN) 2005- 2025 which confirms the Indonesian government’s commitment to gender equality with specific laws in place and aligning the National Development Agenda with 17 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #5 Gender Equality.',\n",
       " \"Gender and social equity challenges and opportunities will be revisited periodically throughout the NEW MAHAKAM project as a way to measure progress and ensure issues are being adequately addressed. The gender bias is commonly emerged linked to some social factors such as ethnicity, faith/religion, and education. Gender refers to the roles, behaviours, activities, attributes and opportunities that any society considers appropriate for girls and boys, and women and men. In the project areas (Delta Mahakam Ulu and Adang Bay), as in other coastal regions of Indonesia, there is a common division of roles between men and women. Men are a group that must earn a living, go to sea to fish, do a variety of physical work, organize village government, manage places of worship, etc., while women's groups do domestic work and help their husbands. Boys usually have a greater chance of going to higher education. With the opening of information, this division of roles experienced a shift, in which several women or girls had the same opportunity to go to school, earn a living and participate in social activities in the village. However, the role of women groups’ policy decision making in the village level is still limited.\",\n",
       " \"In the project area, men generally have no objection regarding women's groups actively engage in activities to earn a living and are also involved in social activities. However, we still note a reluctance among women's groups to actively participate in public meetings that involve men and women due to culturally taboo. The project aims to support the active participation of women's groups through the following activities: Encourage women's involvement in meetings involving sub-village or village interests Provide equal opportunities between women and men for capacity building activities Provide opportunities for women's groups to earn income through micro and small businesses Encourage women's participation to be actively involved in decision making both at the scale of households and at the group level, for example related to tree planting project.\",\n",
       " 'Therefore, PU and its implementing partners will coordinate closely with gender working group at the provincial and district levels to gain more understanding the gender issue, challenge and possible solution in the coastal area. We also try to create gender friendly environment in order to ensure the women has active participation such as identifying the right time for women to participate, separate the women and men group if it will give chance for women to speak, always ask and give chance to women to speak in every meeting. In addition, this project aims to acknowledge the rights of local people in the project by implementing the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) on the project. PU and implementing partners will provide information of the project, the risk, the negative and positive impact of the project and let them decide to contribute on the project. By doing this, the project aims to place the local people not as object the project, but the subject of project since they also contribute to design the activities of the project.',\n",
       " 'Moreover, regarding the new capital, the project expects to bring the voice of local people in the coastal area in shaping the future plan of Mahakam Delta and Adang Bay-Adang Bay. The involvement of local people will contribute to improve the governance in the coastal region. Knowledge management, capitalization & communication Knowledge management Planète Urgence is in the process of setting up a new tool for monitoring plantations based on geolocation of trees planted throughout the project. Planète Urgence’s software (database) will be redesigned and updated to meet different needs. The first one is to conduct the monitoring of planted trees (species, size, survival rate, pictures …). The second one will help provide transparent information to donors. The third one will contribute to communication efforts (map on website).',\n",
       " 'PU Indonesia and its implementing partners will arrange communication and knowledge management mechanisms to ensure all parties has equal access and responsible to store and to distribute the data and information gathered from the project. All materials from the field should be submitted monthly to the communication officer of PU Indonesia during the project. PU Indonesia will ensure all publications, minutes of meeting, report, picture and video related with the project activities store well in the PU system. The material will be grouped according to their type, date and the component of the project. The implementing partners will have equal access to use the materials that they have collected for the benefit of current and future project in the region. Like previous projects, PU Indonesia will spread the lessons learned of the project to the key stakeholders and public through various canal such as monthly journal, offline and online media and social media during the project. Capitalization',\n",
       " 'In order to allow Mahakam Delta’s stakeholders and project partners to replicate the positive actions of the project in other villages for a wider action, Planète Urgence commits to undertake capitalization on two key subjects: (i) a relevant restoration of the mangrove ecosystem and (ii) a methodology for land use planning process. Indeed, the restoration of the mangrove in the Mahakam Delta is an initiative carried for many years by different stakeholders (companies, communities, local governments, associations) and in many cases favouring a monoculture. It would seem that efforts in terms of identification of species and planting areas should be made by communities and public actors - in particular the KPHP - a key player on the subject.',\n",
       " 'In addition, Indonesia faces a lack of human and financial resources to integrate communities in the processes of sustainable management of natural resources and territorial planning. This aspect has been entrusted by the central government to the provinces and districts. However, Planète Urgence’s support has been required by decentralized public actors to facilitate the consultation processes with local communities and to develop proposal for territorial planning and land certification. The project therefore intends to draw methods and tools from it in order to support other local communities and the public stakeholders concerned (villages and districts) in order to replicate these activities with the other villages of the Mahakam Delta.\\nThe tree protection from palm tree leaves and net that successfully works to protect tree in previous project will be documented and spread to the key restoration actors for possible replication in their project. In addition, PU Indonesia will manage and distribute the publication and knowledge from the project to other parties. Module and material environmental education campaign will be used in the scale up project or other locations. Table 3. Summary of our lessons learned, and best practices developed on previous projects in the Mahakam Delta External communication in Indonesia',\n",
       " 'PU Indonesia will work with the online local media to promote the project activities, current states of Delta Mahakam and its challenge. Besides the online local media, PU Indonesia and its implementing partners will work with expert panels in radio panels to spread the message, challenge and the successful of the project. PU Indonesia has been invited by the French IFI (Institut Français Indonesia) on Climate Change week in 2021. The French IF have invited PU Indonesia to spread the message and works through various canals which provided by French IF such as social media and website. This opportunity should be used in this project to introduce the project to wider public. In addition, CIFOR has invited PU as speaker in the side event of Policy and Science dialogue in March 2022. The collaboration with CIFOR can be extended in other events to share the progress of project NEW MAHAKAM. Besides that, PU and its partners will road show to the authority and donor to introduce the project both at the national, provincial and local level. Project brief, blog and others material can be used to spread the messages to those parties. External communication in France',\n",
       " 'At PU headquarters, the communication team will receive local communication content, data, pictures, tools and progress information on the project to create contents (articles, advocacy messages, press releases) in line with the international calendar on biodiversity, climate change and other international celebrations. The project will be promoted, first on PU website by dedicating a specific page to it and attaching any communication elements that may be provided or proposed by YML and Pokja Pesisir. The communication officer of PU Indonesia will work together with communication team of PU HQ to fill the PU Indonesia section in the PU website. The project will be clearly highlighted (infographics, photos, videos, key figures, etc.) on social media. As a member of Groupe SOS, PU benefits from its distribution channels, including its website and its News page. PU will communicate through a specific partner newsletter on its actions thanks to the participation and support from its donors (general public and private sector). The project will be the subject of communication actions targeted to these companies and foundations and will benefit from cascading relays, allowing it to reach a larger audience. Partners will communicate, for their part, on their support for reforestation and local development actions with their employees, service providers and customers.',\n",
       " 'Sustainability, scaling-up and/or exit strategy After the project ending in March 2023, Planète Urgence and its partners will focus on the sustainability of the project in order to design a correct exit strategy of the area for Planète Urgence. Indeed, the mandate of Planète Urgence is to reinforce the capacities of local civil societies. Sustainability and Exit Strategy (Scale Up) of the project Planète Urgence has defined requirement to ensure the efficiency of the NEW MAHAKAM project and the success of the exit strategy in 2023. For it, three approaches must be integrated to each activity: inclusivity, integration and independence.',\n",
       " \"In the context of an inclusive approach, this project encourages the participation of many parties while respecting each other's interests in order to create a synergy of cooperation and mutual support to mangrove conservation efforts in the Mahakam Delta. Then to ensure that all activities undertaken are under the responsibility of identified parties, Planète Urgence will conduct advocacy work to integrate MAHAKAM’s activities into the strategic plans and work plans of the stakeholders of the project. Finally, to ensure the independence with regard to control of interests of other parties outside the Mahakam Delta, it is necessary to strengthen this independence of all actors involved in mangrove conservation efforts in the area. The independence in this case includes the ability to self-financing conservation activities through local economic institutions that are professional to manage sustainable productive businesses. Therefore, during the project and particularly in the end of project, PU and implementing partners will identify and distribute the preliminary achievement and lesson learn of the project to the potential donor. Raising awareness component: Encouraging participation of public particularly change makers in the community with a collaborative work with education institutions and mass media.\",\n",

To do so, Planète Urgence team will develop a baseline scenario illustrating the activities and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would occur in the absence of a project’s activity. Developing this baseline will be the foundation of measuring the project’s emissions reductions or removals; it will set the benchmark by which a comparison of the project’s activities can be made against the business-as-usual scenario providing clarity on how the project can and will influence emissions reductions over time.
