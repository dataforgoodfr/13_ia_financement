Sustainability, scaling-up and/or exit strategy\\nAfter the project ending in March 2023, Planète Urgence and its partners will\\nfocus on the sustainability of the project in order to design a correct exit\\nstrategy of the area for Planète Urgence.

For it,\\nthree approaches must be integrated to each activity: inclusivity, integration\\nand independence. \\nIn  the  context  of  an  inclusive  approach,  this  project  encourages  the\\nparticipation of many parties while respecting each other's interests in order\\nto  create  a  synergy  of  cooperation  and  mutual  support  to  mangrove\\nconservation efforts in the Mahakam Delta. Then to ensure that all activities\\nundertaken are under the responsibility of identified parties, Planète Urgence\\nwill  conduct  advocacy  work  to  integrate  MAHAKAM’s  activities  into  the\\nstrategic plans and work plans of the stakeholders of the project. Finally, to\\nensure the independence with regard to control of interests of other parties\\noutside the Mahakam Delta, it is necessary to strengthen this independence\\nof all  actors  involved  in  mangrove  conservation  efforts  in the  area.

As a result, 54.19% of the Mahakam Delta has been\\nconverted to shrimp ponds.

Therefore,  limited  economic  activities  are  allowed  in  this  area.\\nHowever,  since  the  late  1990s,  massive  clearing  for  the  construction  of\\naquaculture ponds has destroyed the mangrove forest in the area.

Cross-cutting approaches\\nIn 2019, Planète Urgence has conducted a social analysis in Muara Kembang\\nto examine how different individuals and groups may affect the project and\\nhow the project will affect them. During this study, Planète Urgence has\\ncollected,  identified  and  analysed  information  on  the  different  roles,\\nresponsibilities, needs and interests of women and men of targeted groups in\\nMuara  Kembang  village.  To  capture  the  nuances  of  various  social\\ncharacteristics,  the  data  and  analysis  on  women  and  men  should  are\\ndisaggregated  by  social  categories  relevant  to  the  project  (e.g.,  socio-\\neconomic status, profession) during these 3 years.\\nBelow are presented the results of the socio-economic analysis of targeted\\ncommunities, with 80% of respondents.

Boys usually have a greater chance of going to higher education.\\nWith the opening of information, this division of roles experienced a shift, in\\nwhich several women or girls had the same opportunity to go to school, earn\\na living and participate in social activities in the village. However, the role of\\nwomen groups’ policy decision making in the village level is still limited.\\nIn the project area, men generally have no objection regarding women's\\ngroups actively engage in activities to earn a living and are also involved in\\nsocial activities.
