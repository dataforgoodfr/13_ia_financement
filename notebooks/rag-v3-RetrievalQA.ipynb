      "{'query': 'Context, environment, project rationale and challenges', 'result': \"**Context:**\\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted life in Indonesia, particularly in East Kalimantan, which has one of the highest rates of exposure to the virus outside of Java. Since early 2020, the government has imposed lockdowns and restrictions on community activities to curb the spread of the virus. As of early 2022, while community activities began to normalize, the emergence of the Omicron variant posed new challenges. In this ongoing pandemic context, it is crucial for projects aimed at environmental restoration to continue while prioritizing health and safety protocols.\\n\\n**Environment:**\\nEast Kalimantan is home to rich biodiversity, especially within its mangrove ecosystems, which are vital for local livelihoods and community resilience against climate change. However, these ecosystems are under threat due to degradation, which not only impacts the environment but also the local economy and the habitats of endangered species. The coastal areas of East Kalimantan are particularly vulnerable, facing challenges such as a lack of sustainable livelihood alternatives and poor governance regarding environmental management.\\n\\n**Project Rationale:**\\nThe three-year project aims to restore degraded mangrove ecosystems in the Mahakamm Delta and Adang Bay. The rationale for this project is built on addressing several critical issues:\\n1. **Lack of Awareness:** There is a significant gap in local communities' understanding of the importance of mangrove ecosystems, biodiversity, and waste management.\\n2. **Degraded Mangrove Forests:** The extensive degradation of mangrove forests threatens local resilience to climate change, impacts the habitat of endangered species, and undermines the local economy.\\n3. **Sustainable Livelihoods:** There is a pressing need for alternative sustainable livelihoods in coastal areas to reduce reliance on degrading natural resources.\\n4. **Governance Issues:** Poor governance related to mangrove ecosystems and environmental management hampers effective conservation efforts.\\n\\n**Challenges:**\\nThe project faces several challenges, including:\\n- The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, which complicates community engagement and project implementation while necessitating strict adherence to health protocols.\\n- Ensuring the involvement and commitment of local NGOs, communities, and volunteers, which is crucial for the project's success and long-term sustainability.\\n- Overcoming entrenched practices and a lack of awareness that contribute to the degradation of mangrove ecosystems.\\n- Addressing governance issues that hinder effective management and protection of the mangrove environment.\\n\\n**Monitoring and Evaluation:**\\nTo ensure the project's effectiveness and impact, a robust monitoring and evaluation framework will be implemented. This includes:\\n- **Field Monitoring:** Conducting six field monitoring sessions each year to assess progress and adapt strategies as needed.\\n- **Internal Evaluation:** An internal evaluation will be conducted at the end of the project to review overall outcomes and lessons learned.\\n- **Third-Party Evaluation:** A third-party evaluation will take place in the third year, involving both remote assessments and onsite visits. This evaluation will include:\\n  - An inventory of activities related to the project plan, such as planting initiatives, increased livelihoods, and environmental awareness efforts.\\n  - A review of carbon sequestration calculations and monitoring protocols based on the climate philanthropy methodology developed by Planète Urgence. This will involve establishing a baseline scenario for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and demonstrating additionality.\\n  - An analysis of project monitoring and activity reports, culminating in the redaction of an audit report.\\n  - Completion of baseline assessments and proof of additionality, accompanied by ex-ante calculations of GHG emissions/sequestrations.\\n\\n**Strategy & Theory of Change:**\\nTo address these challenges, the project will implement the PU FORET strategy, which focuses on three key components:\\n1. **Restoration of Degraded Forests:** Actively restoring mangrove ecosystems to enhance biodiversity and resilience.\\n2. **Environmental Awareness:** Educating local communities about the importance of mangrove ecosystems, biodiversity, and sustainable waste management practices.\\n3. **Strengthening Livelihoods:** Developing alternative sustainable livelihoods for local communities to reduce dependence on degrading natural resources.\\n\\nThe involvement of local NGOs, community members, and volunteers is essential for the project's success and the sustainability of its impacts. Overall, the project seeks to restore mangrove ecosystems while fostering environmental awareness and strengthening local livelihoods, all within the context of ongoing public health challenges and a rigorous evaluation framework to measure its effectiveness.\", 'source_documents': [Document(metadata={'page': 17, 'source': './data/PROJECT DOCUMENT MAHAKAM 2023-2025_balise.pdf'}, page_content='\\nAnother issue that has also had a major impact on life in Indonesia, including\\nEast Kalimantan, is the Covid 19 global pandemic that has attacked the\\nentire world since early 2020.

    "#### Conclusions:\n",
    "> Type de chaîne RAG à privilégier:\n",
    "* Une chaîne basée sur LCEL est à retenir, la chaîne basée sur le `retrievalQA` étant à banir totalement car bien trop coûteux en temps/tokens, et offrant des moins bonnes réponses \n",
    "> DB à privilégier:\n",
    "*  La DB FAISS démontre un score légèrement supérieur à Chroma (> 0.5 points), et un temps de retrait 4 fois plus rapide\n",
    "> Type de recherche appliquée au retriever à privilégier:\n",
    "* La méthode `MMR`de part son equilibre diversité/pertinence des documents retournés offre de bons résultats, les méthodes plus simples uniquement basées sur le cosine similarity donnent de très mauvais résultats \n",
    "> Ré écriture automatique des questions:\n",
    "* Cette ré-écriture est bénéfique (augmentation du score moyen de 0.7), mais elle repose ici sur des exemples explicites tirées de l'AAP ici traitée (dépôt sur site). Il faut tester si ces exemples sont toujours opérants pour d'autres APP, s'il est nécessaire de reprendre les exemples du document \"Guide pratique pour les nouveaux arrivants\" \n",
    "> Evaluation des résultats:\n",
    "* Déleguer l'évaluation à un LLM avancé (gpt 4o ici) permet un bon niveau de confiance sur la pertinence des réponses/textes de référence, et capture bien mieux les nuances qui font qu'une réponse est factuellement juste (VS texte de référence), à l'inverse d'un modèle spécialisé comme `MiniCheck flan T5`, qui a échoue lorsque la strcucture et le naratif de la réponse différe trop du texte de référence, alors que les faits rapportés (lieux, chiffres) sont exactement les mêmes (voir questions/réponses 4 et 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prochaines étapes:\n",
    "* Expérimenter avec sparse retriever (basé sur la fréquence des mots) et lexical retriever (basé sur l'indexation des mots)\n",
    "* Expérimenter avec un reranker"
