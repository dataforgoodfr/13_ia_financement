Although  the\nIndonesia President commit to develop the new capital as Forest and Smart\nCity,  the  surrounding  area  particularly  the  coastal  area  such  as  Delta\nMahakam and Adang Bay might get high pressure as the consequence of the\nnew  development  and  the  movement  of  1.5  million  people  to  the  new\ncapital.    \nDelta Mahakam, in the eastern part of East Kalimantan, is an area that is\nrelatively close to the prospective center of the State capital (about 100 km).\nMahakam Delta is naturally a mangrove habitat, but due to excessive land\nclearing for extensive aquaculture about 47.5 % of the mangrove ecosystem\nis  degraded  to  be  converted  into  aquaculture  (2017).  Despite  various\nconservation efforts by different parties and the government, land clearing\nstill continues. Delta Mahakam land ownership is government land that has\ndesignated  as  a  production  forest,  but  this  area  has  been  inhabited  by\nresidents from generation to generation.\nAdang Bay is one of the coastal villages in Adang Bay, Paser Regency, on the\nsouthern part of East Kalimantan Province  (about 100 km from the new\ncapital).  This  area  is  also  experiencing  land  conversion  to  increase\naquaculture, besides there are several locations in coastal areas that are\naffected by abrasion. Restoration activities in East Kalimantan Province are\nneeded to restore a degraded environment, as well as to support the vision\nof the nation's capital as a green city.\nThe  ecosystem  in  Delta  Mahakam  and  Adang  Bay1 are  also  home  to\ncritically  endangered  species,  such  as  the  nasal  monkey  (proboscis\nmonkey), endemic to the island of Borneo. On a global scale, the mangrove\nis a key ecosystem to answer the challenge of carbon sequestration and\nfight against climate change.\nThe  objective  of  the  project  is  therefore  to  contribute  to  restore  the\ndegraded mangrove forest in East Kalimantan (Delta Mahakam and Adang\nBay)  as  home  of  endemic  and  endangered  species  including  proboscis\nmonkey and key ecosystem to mitigate and to adapt the impact of climate\nchange;  and  this,  through  four  main  actions:  raising  awareness  of  the\nstakeholders,  rehabilitating  degraded  mangrove  forest,  supporting  the\n1 For clarification: \n- Delta Mahakam (the region), Kutai Kartanegara District, Delta Mahakam Sub \nDistrict and Delta Mahakam Ulu the village.\n- Adang Bay (the region), Paser District, Long Ikis Sub District and Adang Bay the \nvillage.\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\ndevelopment  of  sustainable  livelihood,  and  strengthening  the  coastal\ngovernance.\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\nMain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to which the\nproject contributes\n      \n      \n      \n      \n            \nMain SDG targets and indicators to which the project contributes: \n 12.8.

This\norganization  was  formed  with  the  objective  to  raise  public  attention  to\npreserve  coastal  and  marine  ecosystems  that  are  rich  in  biodiversity,\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\nincluding clusters of mangrove areas, distribution of coral reefs and seagrass\nbeds.\nIn addition, government policies towards fishermen communities also need\nto be continuously encouraged in order to be optimal for the welfare of\nfishermen.  The  lives  of  fishermen  in  coastal  areas  in  East  Kalimantan\nProvince  often  experience  difficulties  due  to  the  privatization  of  coastal\nareas, difficulties in obtaining fuel for fishing boats, and also low human\nresources.\nBased on these issues, a group of activists agreed in 2009 to establish an\norganization which was later named the “Coastal and Fisherman Working\nGroup”. This institution has been advocating policies for improving coastal\nand marine governance and carrying out empowerment actions for fishing\ncommunities. As an effort to preserve the coastal area, the “Coastal and\nFishermen Working Group” initiated a program called Mangrove and Marine\nProtection Area in Teritip Village, East Balikpapan Sub-district, Balikpapan\nCity, in collaboration with UNDP in 2009 – 2010.

Context & environment and development challenges\nGeographic and socio-economic context\nEast Kalimantan is one of the richest provinces in Indonesia and the main\ncontribution to the national GDP. Before palm oil and mining coal booming in\nearly 2000, forestry, mining and gas sectors are the backbone of economic\ndevelopment  in  East  Kalimantan.  Because  too  much  depending  on  the\nunrenewable  natural resources, the economic  growth  of East Kalimantan\ngradually declines and, in 2016, reached the minus point because of the\nlowest price of coal at the global level. In 2019, Indonesia government has\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\ndecided to move the capital of Indonesia from Jakarta to East Kalimantan.\nCurrently, the government accelerate the infrastructure development of new\ncapital.   \nThe project will be implemented in several regions of Mahakam Delta and\nAdang Bay. Mahakam Delta is located on the eastern coast of the island of\nBorneo, in East Kalimantan province, which is one of the five provinces that\nhas the lowest population density in Indonesia. This province is also the main\ncontributor to the national GDP, mainly for its wealth in oil and gas. It is\nnevertheless aquaculture activities which constitute the main source of\nincome for the local population. About 90% of the population depend on it\nfor their livelihood. As a result, 54.19% of the Mahakam Delta has been\nconverted to shrimp ponds. The majority of exports from the area are made\nup of tiger shrimp and white shrimp that",

As a result, 54.19% of the Mahakam Delta has been\nconverted to shrimp ponds. The majority of exports from the area are made\nup of tiger shrimp and white shrimp that are farmed in the delta ponds and\nalong the Paser District's shore.\nFeature 1: Land cover in mahakam delta and adang is dominated by fish\npond area\nPaser District is located on the east coast of East Kalimantan Province. The\nvillage of Adang Bay is located in the coastal area of this district, in Adang\nBay. This area is a conservation area managed by the Ministry of Forestry\n(KPHP).  Therefore,  limited  economic  activities  are  allowed  in  this  area.\nHowever,  since  the  late  1990s,  massive  clearing  for  the  construction  of\naquaculture ponds has destroyed the mangrove forest in the area. According\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\nto the District Pastor's Investment Agency, about 1,506 people live in Adang\nBay. Most of them work as fishermen, fish farmers and swallowers. The\nvillage government and the community have made a strong commitment to\nconserve the area by adhering to the jurisdictional REDD+ approach, funded\nby the World Bank's FCPF or Forest Carbon Partnership Facility Project.  \nEnvironmental context\nLargest archipelago in the world (more than 13,000 islands), Indonesia has\nan area of 1,905,000 km2 of which less than 50% is still covered by forests\ntoday,  while  the  country  is  part  of  the  3rd largest planetary tropical\nforest zone  (after the Amazon and the Congo Basin). More than half of\nIndonesian forests have disappeared since 1960. However, they are home to\na large part of the world's biodiversity (more than 10% respectively of plant,\nmammal, reptile and bird species). Today, the country counts for 3 to 5% of\nannual global greenhouse gas emissions  (among the 10 most emitting\ncountries) including more than 50% due to land use, their change of land use\nand the exploitation of forests.\nIndonesia  is  home  to  almost  1/4 of  the  world's  mangroves  (20%). This\nmaritime ecosystem, made up of a set of mainly woody plants (the most\nnotable species being the mangrove), develops in the swinging area of the\ntides of the low coasts and in marshes at the mouth of certain rivers.  Of the\nnearly 3.2 million hectares of mangrove forest 2 in the country today, more\nthan 50,000 ha are lost each year. \nThe mangrove is one of the most productive ecosystems on the planet ,\nhome to a particularly abundant biomass. The mangroves' root system is\nnotably a biotope where a variety of fish and crabs live and reproduce. The\nmangrove thus provides important resources (forestry and fishery) to coastal\npopulations, a natural “buffer” zone adapted to salinity, filtering sediment\nand pollution carried by rivers and the sea, and preserving the fresh water\nresources  of  the  land.  They  are  a  food  security  and  livelihood  issue,  in\nparticular providing income to fishing communities. This ecosystem is also\nan important natural fount of carbon, with Indonesian mangroves storing\naround  5  times  more  carbon  per  hectare  than  terrestrial  forests.  The\ngovernment of Indonesia has taken into account this ecosystem in its REDD+\nstrategy, implemented in the only pilot province of East-Kalimantan, with the\nProvincial Council on Climate Change (DDPI) with the support of the World\nBank in the framework of the “Forest Carbon Partnership Facility Project”.\nFinally, the mangrove plays a key role in  natural defense . The complex\nnetwork of mangrove roots can help reduce wave power, which limits erosion\nand protects  coastal communities  from  the destructive  forces  of tropical\nstorms. Mangroves provide protection against extreme weather events and\ntsunamis, and can adapt to rising sea levels and subsidence. They therefore\n2 Indonesia’s Geospatial Agency, 2012\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\ncontribute to reducing the risk of disasters, to the resilience of communities\nand ecosystems and to their adaptation to climate change.\nIn Mahakam Delta, results from a study conducted in 2018 and 2019 by the\nKutai Kartanegara District has shown that 47.8% of mangrove forests are\ndeteriorated.\nTable 1.

The central government has planned to create a green city for the\nnew capital, which construction will start in 2022, but various problems still\npose challenges in locations outside the new capital. On the one hand, a\nclose government center can control the surrounding environment to keep it\nconserved, but the gap in the quality of human resources and plans to move\na  large  number  of  people  from  Jakarta  to  this  area  will  certainly  cause\npressure on the environment.\nBiodiversity issues\nThe  mangrove  of  Mahakam  Delta  conceals  a  rich  marine  and  arboreal\nbiodiversity,  characterized by a large variety of  fish, arthropods, reptiles\nsuch as the marine crocodile  (Crocodylus porosus) , aquatic mammals such\nas the Irrawaddy dolphin  (Orcaella brevirostris)  or terrestrial like the nasal\nmonkey  (Nasalis larvatus),  these last 2 species being considered as being\n“endangered” by the IUCN.\nThe  deforestation  of Mahakam Delta’s mangrove hampers the effort to\nconserve this type of species, for example by fragmenting the habitat of the\nnasal monkey, whose interaction between populations strongly depends on\nthe continuity of the canopy. The isolation of these populations makes them\nmore vulnerable to poaching.  The long-nosed monkey, endemic of Borneo\nIsland is listed as “Endangered” by the IUCN as it has undergone extensive\n3 Study of identification of levels of mangrove forest damaged for rebooting planning in \nMahakam Delta in Kutai Kartanegara district.

Kukar\nVol. 13 No. 1 Tahun 2019\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\npopulation  reductions  across its  range, and ongoing  hunting and habitat\ndestruction  continue  to  threaten  most  populations.  Numbers  have\ndeclined by more than 50%  (but probably less than 80%) over the past 3\ngenerations (approximately 36-40 years). 4 At the scale of Mahakam Delta,\nonly 2 censuses have been conducted to monitor this specie, respectively in\n1997 and 2005 which reflects the lack of resources of local institutions to\nconserve and protect this biodiversity.\nIn addition, the degradation of this ecosystem leads to a decrease in fish\nstocks in the delta, threatening both fishermen and species such as sea\ncrocodiles  and  dolphins.  The  situation  is  currently  might  threatening  to\nexacerbate human-animal conflicts and therefore to further decrease the\npopulations of the above-mentioned species, even threatening them with\nextinction. Hence, beside preventing the mangrove forest conversion into\npalm oil plantation, aquaculture ponds, and other usages, the reforestation\nactivity is necessary to improve the degraded mangrove ecosystem in the\ncoastal area.\nParadoxically, the considerable modification of delta habitats resulted in a\nvery substantial  increase in populations of birds  associated with open\nwet  areas,  such  as  egrets  (100  individuals  in  1987  to  nearly  15,000\nindividuals  in  2013).  Likewise,  some  species  of  heron  have  seen  their\npopulation sizes increase considerably, such as the purple heron or the Javan\npond-heron,  the  lesser  adjutant,  ducks,  Sunda  teal  and  the  wandering\nwhistling-duck also seem to have used the habitats created by the clearings\nto considerably increase their populations. \nThe populations of these species have benefited of new feeding areas when\nthe shrimp ponds were developed. Indeed, egrets, ducks, and waders use\nthe shrimp ponds in high numbers on cyclical basis when shrimp ponds are\nemptied for shrimp harvesting. The presence of pristine areas, with large\ntrees  or  dense  copses  of  smaller  species  (Nypa)  removed  from  human\npresence, is also favourable for the reproduction of these species. Here they\nfind quiet conditions for reproduction or gatherings (dormitories). Amongst\nthe species observed in 2013 and those not observed in 1987, eight dwell in\nan aquatic environment and directly depend on the shrimp ponds: darter,\nstilts, grey heron, black-crowned night heron, intermediate egret, western\nmarsh-harrier  and  the  Garganey.  The  opening  of  shrimp  ponds  was  the\nobvious factor leading to the growth of all these bird populations.\nInstitutional Context \nThe  key  players  in  coastal  region  in  East  Kalimantan  including  in  Delta\nMahakam  Ulu  (Delta  Mahakam)  and  Delta  Mahakam  (Adang  Bay)  are\nrelatively similar.

Besides government, the\nothers key actors are fishermen, fish farmers, swallow workers and investors\nin aquaculture sectors. Those actors have shaped the landscape of coastal\narea in Delta Mahakam and Adang Bay over the past 20 years. In their hand\nthe future  of sustainable  aquaculture  is determined.  Environmental and\ndevelopment NGOs, oil and gas company and other parties has programme\nin their area. Most of the programme focus on improving the livelihood of the\nlocal people and restoring the mangrove forest.\nThe Movement of Indonesian New Capital\nPaser District (East Kalimantan Province) will soon be the site of Indonesia's\nnew political capital, Nusantara, as part of the plan to move the country's\ncapital from the island of Java to the island of Borneo, which is home to one\nof the world’s largest rainforests.  \nJakarta,  the  current  political  capital  which  will  become  the  country's\neconomic capital by 2045, is currently facing several environmental, climatic\nand demographic problems and challenges: overpopulation, heavy pollution,\nrising water levels, frequent flooding, etc. In order to deal with the inevitable\nfuture security issue, the Indonesian government has decided to build a new\ncapital 2,000 km away from Jakarta, in the province of East Kalimantan,\nmore precisely between the towns of Balikpapan and Samarinda. With the\nlegislation  for  the  relocation  of  the  new  capital  published,  the  physical\ndevelopment of the new capital will begin in 2022. In August 2024, the\nPresident  plans  to  celebrate  Indonesia's  Independence  Day  in  the  new\ncapital. \nThe government plans to make the new capital a \"forest city\" by strongly\npreserving forest areas and using sustainable energy. However, many argue\nthat  the  development  of  the  new  capital  could  lead  to  environmental\ndegradation and loss of essential biodiversity, especially in the mangrove\nforest.  The  majority  of  the  Indonesian  population,  including  the  local\npopulation, supports the new capital movement by echoing the effect of\nequitable  development.  Indeed,  for  decades,  the  natural  resources  of\nKalimantan Island have been exploited to support Indonesian development,\nespecially that of Java Island.  \nThe location of the project (Delta Mahakam and Adang Bay -Adang Bay) is an\narea relatively close to the potential centre of the state capital (about 100-\n200 km).\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\nEnvironment and development challenges\na) Aquaculture industry\nMahakam  Delta  area  is  under  pressure  from  both  the  industrial  and\nagricultural sectors, including aquaculture facing a national high dynamic.\nFrom 2015 to 2035 it is expected a destruction of 600,000 ha of mangrove\nfor shrimp farm at the national scale. The World Bank (2013) estimates a\npressure to double cultivated shrimp production from currently 300,000 t\n(produced by 600,000 ha of ponds) to 600,000 t/1,000,000 t by 2030 to fulfil\nthe demand. However, with improvements in brackish water aquaculture\nproductivity,  halting  palm  oil  concession  to  use  mangroves,  along  with\nmaintaining other mangrove use pressures at moderate levels, the net loss\nof mangroves in the next two decades could be reduced to around 23,000 ha\nat this same scale. \nThe East-Kalimantan Province is the new area to develop aquaculture ponds\nas  Java,  Sumatra  and  Sulawesi  islands  are  facing  a  decrease  of  the\nproduction and the destruction of their environment due to unsustainable\npractices. \nFeature 1: Forecasted mangrove loss at six mangrove regions in Indonesia\nin the next two decades due to land use change under pessimistic scenario.\nCircle size indicates potential loss areas in Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Papua;\nas for Java, Sulawesi and Maluku potential loss areas are represented by the\nsmaller circles.\nScientific  studies  also  show  that  the  percentage  of  mangrove  natural\nrecovery is higher in East-Kalimantan with 1.4%/year against 0.7%/year in\nother  islands  in  inactive  ponds.

Indeed, the announcement\nin 2019 of the relocation of the political and administrative capital of Jakarta\nto the province of East Kalimantan, between the cities of Balikpapan and\nSamarinda, suggests strong migrations, the development of infrastructures\nbut  also  a  growing  demand  for  aquaculture  products.  By  2024,  the\nIndonesian Minister of Planning hopes to transfer nearly 1.5 million public\nofficials and political representatives in East Kalimantan.\nDelta  Mahakam Ulu village,  which  belongs  to Delta  Mahakam district,  is\nlocated in the northern part of the Mahakam Delta. The location of Delta\nMahakam sub-district is close to the state-owned oil company (Pertamina),\nformerly  VICO.  Due  to  the  proximity  of  a  fairly  large  company,  the\ncommunity's economy is quite dynamic and the area offers a variety of jobs.\nHowever, the number of people who still carry out the traditional work of\nfishermen and fish farmers is still quite high, especially in the coastal areas.\nWorking as a fish farmer has become one of the choices of the community as\nland is available for opening ponds. The conversion of mangrove forests into\nponds has been going on for decades, but the production of fish and shrimp\nhas decreased from time to time. Based on various studies and research,\nplanting a number of mangroves in ponds can improve the soil and water\nquality in the ponds so that they can provide sustainable production.

Strategy & theory of change\nThe  three  years  project  aims  to  contribute  to  restore  the  degraded  of\nmangrove  ecosystem  in  Production  Forest  (Mahakamm  Delta)  and\nConservation area (Adang Bay). In doing so, the project will address the key\nproblems in those regions: \na. Lack  of  awareness  of  local  people  on  mangrove  ecosystem,\nbiodiversity issue and waste\nb. Huge area of degraded mangrove forest which affect the resilience of\nlocal  people  in  facing  climate  change,  the  habitat  of  endangered\nspecies and local economy;\nc. Lack of alternative sustainable livelihood in coastal area;\nd. Poor  governance  particularly  on  mangrove  ecosystem  and  its\nenvironmental and economy issue.   \nTo overcome those problems, Planet Urgence and its partners will work by\nimplementing the PU FORET strategy which rely on three components:\n1. Restore degraded forest;\n2. Environmental awareness;\n3. Strengthening livelihood of local people. \nIn addition, the involvement of local NGOs, local community and volunteer is\nkey for the successful of the project and the sustainability the impact of the\nproject. Therefore, PU will reinforce the capacity of those local stakeholders\nto ensure they can carry out the project activities and together achieve the\nlong-term goal of the project. \nDiagram of the theory of change can be seen below or in this link  Proyek\nNEW MAHAKAM 2023-2026 -TOC - 3.xlsx\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\nFeature 3.

East\nKalimantan is a province with the second largest area of mangrove forest\nafter Papua Province, but there is very little material about mangroves in\nschool subjects. The workshop experience with elementary school teachers\nin Muara Jawa District in 2021 showed that schools really need knowledge\nabout the mangrove ecosystem so that they can teach knowledge to the\nstudents as early as possible. Campaigns and hands-on learning bring fun for\nthe teacher and students and will be memorized for a long time.\nActivity  1.1. Conduct  workshops  in  schools  of  East  Kalimantan\nprovince  to  raise  awareness  on  environment  and  biodiversity\npreservation. \nThree sub-activities will be conducted:\n1.1.1.  -Workshop  on  Environmental  Conservation  for  Primary  School\nTeachers\nThe objective of this sub-activity is to increase teachers' knowledge in the\nfield of environmental conservation, especially the mangrove ecosystem and\nits  biodiversity.

Conduct  public  awareness  campaigns  to  sensitize\ncommunities  in  East  Kalimantan  province  to  the  ecological,\neconomic and climatic benefits of the mangrove.\nEast  Kalimantan  Province  has  the  second  largest  mangrove  forest  in\nIndonesia, but the knowledge and understanding of the community is still\nlacking about this very useful mangrove ecosystem. When viewed in the\nmedia and in the study program at universities, terrestrial forests receive\nmore  attention  than  mangrove  forests.  Public  campaign  is  needed  to\nincrease public awareness in general that East Kalimantan Province has an\necosystem  that  is  rich  in  benefits  and  needs  to  be  maintained  and\nsafeguarded  together.  Maintaining  the  mangrove  ecosystem  in  East\nKalimantan is even more relevant because, starting in 2022, Indonesia will\nmove the country's capital to East Kalimantan Province. The movement of\nthe state capital will increase the mobility of the population and will increase\nthe pressure on the environment.\n1.3.1. Waste Management Campaign\nThere  are  intervention  villages  where  have  habit  to  throw  away  their\ngarbage under their floating house. The objective of this campaign is to\nincrease  awareness  to  the  local  community  about  waste  management\nproperly. There is a link between their bad habits and the environment; when\nthe tide arrives, the trash is washed away and accumulates in the roots of\nthe mangroves, which results in the death of the mangrove plants.

Cross-cutting approaches\nIn 2019, Planète Urgence has conducted a social analysis in Muara Kembang\nto examine how different individuals and groups may affect the project and\nhow the project will affect them. During this study, Planète Urgence has\ncollected,  identified  and  analysed  information  on  the  different  roles,\nresponsibilities, needs and interests of women and men of targeted groups in\nMuara  Kembang  village.  To  capture  the  nuances  of  various  social\ncharacteristics,  the  data  and  analysis  on  women  and  men  should  are\ndisaggregated  by  social  categories  relevant  to  the  project  (e.g.,  socio-\neconomic status, profession) during these 3 years.\nBelow are presented the results of the socio-economic analysis of targeted\ncommunities, with 80% of respondents. The last Gender Gap Report 2020 of\nthe World Economic Forum has ranked Indonesia on position 86 on a total of\n153 countries regarding gender inclusion and equality. The National Gender\nMainstreaming Policy enacted in 2000 (through The Presidential Decree in)\nguides the National Long-term Development Plan (RPJPN) 2005- 2025 which\nconfirms the Indonesian government’s commitment to gender equality with\nspecific laws in place and aligning the National Development Agenda with 17\nSustainable Development Goal (SDG) #5 Gender Equality.\nGender  and  social  equity  challenges  and  opportunities  will  be  revisited\nperiodically throughout the NEW MAHAKAM project as a way to measure\nprogress and ensure issues are being adequately addressed. The gender bias\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\nis  commonly  emerged  linked  to  some  social  factors  such  as  ethnicity,\nfaith/religion,  and  education.  Gender  refers  to  the  roles,  behaviours,\nactivities, attributes and opportunities that any society considers appropriate\nfor girls and boys, and women and men. \nIn the project areas (Delta Mahakam Ulu and Adang Bay), as in other coastal\nregions of Indonesia, there is a common division of roles between men and\nwomen. Men are a group that must earn a living, go to sea to fish, do a\nvariety of physical work, organize village government, manage places of\nworship,  etc.,  while  women's  groups  do  domestic  work  and  help  their\nhusbands. Boys usually have a greater chance of going to higher education.\nWith the opening of information, this division of roles experienced a shift, in\nwhich several women or girls had the same opportunity to go to school, earn\na living and participate in social activities in the village. However, the role of\nwomen groups’ policy decision making in the village level is still limited.\nIn the project area, men generally have no objection regarding women's\ngroups actively engage in activities to earn a living and are also involved in\nsocial activities. However, we still note a reluctance among women's groups\nto actively participate in public meetings that involve men and women due\nto culturally taboo.\nThe  project  aims  to  support  the  active  participation  of  women's  groups\nthrough the following activities:\n Encourage women's involvement in meetings involving sub-village or\nvillage interests \n Provide  equal  opportunities  between  women  and  men  for  capacity\nbuilding activities\n Provide  opportunities  for  women's  groups  to  earn  income  through\nmicro and small businesses\n Encourage women's participation to",

By doing this, the project aims to place \nthe local people not as object the project, but the subject of project since \nthey also contribute to design the activities of the project. \nMoreover, regarding the new capital, the project expects to bring the voice \nof local people in the coastal area in shaping the future plan of Mahakam \nDelta and Adang Bay-Adang Bay. The involvement of local people will \ncontribute to improve the governance in the coastal region.\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\n9. Knowledge  management,  capitalization  &\ncommunication\nKnowledge management\nPlanète Urgence is in the process of setting up a new tool for monitoring\nplantations based on geolocation of trees planted throughout the project.\nPlanète Urgence’s software (database) will be redesigned and updated to\nmeet different needs. The first one is to conduct the monitoring of planted\ntrees (species, size, survival rate, pictures …). The second one will help\nprovide transparent information to donors. The third one will contribute to\ncommunication efforts (map on website).\nPU Indonesia and its implementing partners will arrange communication and\nknowledge management mechanisms to ensure all parties has equal access\nand responsible to store and to distribute the data and information gathered\nfrom the project. All materials from the field should be submitted monthly to\nthe communication officer of PU Indonesia during the project. PU Indonesia\nwill ensure all publications, minutes of meeting, report, picture and video\nrelated with the project activities store well in the PU system. The material\nwill be grouped according to their type, date and the component of the\nproject.  The  implementing  partners  will  have  equal  access  to  use  the\nmaterials  that  they  have  collected  for  the  benefit  of  current  and future\nproject in the region. Like previous projects, PU Indonesia will spread the\nlessons learned of the project to the key stakeholders and public through\nvarious canal such as monthly journal, offline and online media and social\nmedia during the project.\nCapitalization\nIn  order  to  allow  Mahakam Delta’s  stakeholders  and  project  partners  to\nreplicate the positive actions of the project in other villages for a wider\naction,  Planète  Urgence  commits  to  undertake  capitalization  on  two  key\nsubjects: (i) a relevant restoration of the mangrove ecosystem and (ii) a\nmethodology for land use planning process. \nIndeed,  the restoration of the mangrove  in the Mahakam Delta is an\ninitiative  carried  for  many  years  by  different  stakeholders  (companies,\ncommunities, local governments, associations) and in many cases favouring\na monoculture. It would seem that efforts in terms of identification of species\nand planting areas should be made by communities and public actors - in\nparticular the KPHP - a key player on the subject. \nIn  addition,  Indonesia  faces  a  lack  of  human  and  financial  resources  to\nintegrate communities in the processes of  sustainable management of\nnatural  resources  and  territorial  planning. This  aspect  has  been\nentrusted by the central government to the provinces and districts. However,\nPlanète Urgence’s support has been required by decentralized public actors\nto  facilitate  the  consultation  processes  with  local  communities  and  to\ndevelop proposal for territorial planning and land certification. The project\ntherefore intends to draw methods and tools from it in order to support other\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\nlocal  communities  and  the  public  stakeholders  concerned  (villages  and\ndistricts) in order to replicate these activities with the other villages of the\nMahakam Delta.\nThe tree protection from palm tree leaves and net that successfully works to\nprotect tree in previous project will be documented and spread to the key\nrestoration actors for possible replication in their project. In addition, PU\nIndonesia will manage and distribute the publication and knowledge from the\nproject  to  other  parties.

PU Indonesia has been invited by the French IFI\n(Institut Français Indonesia) on Climate Change week in 2021. The French IF\nhave invited PU Indonesia to spread the message and works through various\ncanals which provided by French IF such as social media and website.

In addition, CIFOR has invited PU as speaker in the side event of\nPolicy and Science dialogue in March 2022. The collaboration with CIFOR can\nbe extended in other events to share the progress of project NEW MAHAKAM.\nBesides that, PU and its partners will road show to the authority and donor to\nintroduce the project both at the national, provincial and local level.

Indeed, the mandate of Planète\nUrgence is to reinforce the capacities of local civil societies.\nSustainability and Exit Strategy (Scale Up) of the project\nPlanète Urgence has defined requirement to ensure the efficiency of the\nNEW MAHAKAM project and the success of the exit strategy in 2023. For it,\nthree approaches must be integrated to each activity: inclusivity, integration\nand independence. \nIn  the  context  of  an  inclusive  approach,  this  project  encourages  the\nparticipation of many parties while respecting each other's interests in order\nto  create  a  synergy  of  cooperation  and  mutual  support  to  mangrove\nconservation efforts in the Mahakam Delta. Then to ensure that all activities\nundertaken are under the responsibility of identified parties, Planète Urgence\nwill  conduct  advocacy  work  to  integrate  MAHAKAM’s  activities  into  the\nstrategic plans and work plans of the stakeholders of the project. Finally, to\nensure the independence with regard to control of interests of other parties\noutside the Mahakam Delta, it is necessary to strengthen this independence\nof all  actors  involved  in  mangrove  conservation  efforts  in the  area. The\nindependence in this case includes the ability to self-financing conservation\nactivities through local economic institutions that are professional to manage\nsustainable  productive  businesses.  Therefore,  during  the  project  and\nparticularly in the end of project, PU and implementing partners will identify\nand distribute the preliminary achievement and lesson learn of the project to\nthe potential donor.\nRaising awareness component: \n Encouraging participation of public particularly change makers in the\ncommunity with a collaborative work with education institutions and mass\nmedia.\n Advocate  and  ensure  education  and  awareness  on  mangrove\nconservation is adopted in school curricula and understood by education\nauthorities and mass media program. \n Develop materials of education and awareness campaign on mangrove\nconservation  (education  curricula,  education  books  and  other  mangrove\neducation tools).\nMangrove rehabilitation component: \n Developing village and community owned nursery to provide seedlings\nfor restoring target area.\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\n Facilitate  village  to create restoration policy,  for instance  replacing\nevery single cut in development zone with planting 100 trees in the target\nrestoration area.\nEconomic development component: \n Develop  community-based  enterprise  to  support  local  resources\nproduct processing and marketing.\n Bridging community network to market and financial institutions.\n Identify  the  challenge  and  opportunity  to  develop  sustainable\naquaculture.\nGovernance Component \n Distribute the result of workshop/FGD regarding the Indonesian new\ncapital to the key stakeholders.  \n Identify the possible strategies and activities in the future to advocacy\nthe green coastal area in East Kalimantan.  \nTransversal to the project: \n Ensure  that  implementing  partners  (YML  and  Pokja  Pesisir)  have\ncapacities to raise funds from public and or private sectors to support their\nactivities in Mahakam Delta, Paser and East Kalimantan in general. \n Ensure that all implementing partners and stakeholders of project area\nhave access and understand each methodology developed in the framework\nof the NEW MAHAKAM project to replicate and adapt the activities in other\nlocations of Mahakam Delta.\n Ensure  that  capacity-building  needs  of  implementing  partners  are\nsupported in order to access the autonomy of each organization.\n\nPlanète Urgence | FOREST Programme\n<table>\n11.
